          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a BSc Computer Science (AI & Machine Learning) student at SIM Global Education (University of London),
            and I like building things that live on the internet. That ranges from interactive JavaScript projects and React apps,
            to multi-page sites and small tools for founders.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work sits at the intersection of <strong>code</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>communication</strong>.
            I enjoy writing clean, understandable code, but I also care about how the UI feels, how content is structured, and
            whether the final experience actually helps the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve also been involved in marketing and analytics work, especially for a B2B leadership
            and simulation-based learning company. That experience gave me a realistic view of how technology, positioning and
            communication come together in real projects — not just in assignments — and it influences how I think about what I build as a developer.

          <h2>Beyond Code — How I Think About Products</h2>
          <p>
            Alongside my technical work, I’ve spent time looking at how products are actually discovered and experienced — especially through
            my work with GlassRoom, a leadership and simulation-based learning company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically, that has meant helping analyse outreach experiments, looking at LinkedIn performance, and understanding how content,
            messaging and basic web presence influence credibility. It has also made me more aware of how small changes in UX, clarity
            and structure can affect whether someone engages or drops off.
          </p>
          <p>
            This complements my development work: I don’t just write code, I try to understand the context in which it runs — who it is for,
            how they arrive there, and what “success” looks like for the product or feature.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-highlight reveal-on-scroll delay-1">
          <h3>What this work has taught me</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How to think from the user’s and stakeholder’s perspective, not just the developer’s</li>
            <li>How product, messaging and implementation connect to business goals</li>
            <li>How to break vague ideas into clear deliverables and realistic timelines</li>
            <li>How to communicate constraints and trade-offs clearly</li>
            <li>How to balance creativity with structure, deadlines and reporting</li>
